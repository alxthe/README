# About me
- 👀 I’m super interested in AI/ML, BCI, and startups!
- 📸 Ideal hangout: walking around a park with water, eating food, talking, and taking pics on my Canon camera
- 🌱 Programming's like a "it's complicated" relationship status: I love it, hate it, but can't live without it 
- 🍣 Cooking up a storm in the kitchen, I'm down to nerd out about food!
- 🎸 Playing guitar is my jam (acoustic and classical), here's my favorite [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2NqZsu6mwQGlIuuI1R4TLj?si=3d68853853fe45dc) 
- 😌 Pronouns: He/Him
